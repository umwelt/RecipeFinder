Recipe Puppy has a very simple API. This api lets you search through recipe puppy database of over a million recipes by keyword and/or by search query. We only ask that you link back to Recipe Puppy and let me know if you are going to perform more than 1,000 requests a day. 

The api is accessible at http://www.recipepuppy.com/api/. 

For example:
http://www.recipepuppy.com/api/?i=onions,garlic&q=omelet&p=3 

Optional Parameters:
i : comma delimited ingredients
q : normal search query
p : page
format=xml : if you want xml instead of json
